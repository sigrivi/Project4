# Project4


In project4b2.py all functions are defined, and if you run the file, you get the plots of E(T), M(T), C_V(T), chi(T) fot the 2x2 case
project4c.py plots energy and magnetization as a function of the number of MC cycles fr the 20x20 lattice. 
  You can choose wheter you want all aligned or random initial spin configuration.
  These figures are used to evaluate the equilibration time
project4d.py plots histogram of the energy for T=1 and T=2.4 for the 20x20 lattice.
  It also give the standard deviation.
project4e.py plots E(T), M(T), C_V(T), chi(T) for different lattice sizes. The figuraes are used to examine phase transition.
